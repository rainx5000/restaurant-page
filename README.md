We will have three tabs

home, menu, and contact

We will have 5 src files,

home.js, menu.js, contact.js, and data.js, and index.js


home.js, menu.js, contact.js

This file would have a module where it will export a function that would create the DOM of what it represents

data.js
This file would contain a module of data we would use, such menu items information, about us information, etc, this will hold our data that will be used across the modules

index.js

This file would wrap all of the tabs together, it will contain the navigation here, and the logic for the navigation to work as tabs. 


TASKS:

1 - first we will create the navigation in the index.js file
2 - we will add the logic that would switch tabs each coming from the js files. If I click on menu, the tab that is created under menu.js would be appended to the index.js file


Create the data module, we will return
